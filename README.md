TIU is a joint Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy-Boston Latin Academy Project that promotes civic engagement and social entrepreneurship among high school students at the Boston Latin School. The program is based on the use of primary data collection and analysis to allow students to become agents of change by gathering real evidence about where they live.

Students will be collecting data, which will be submitted to this site and then displayed. The site will consist of three main pages: What We Eat, Community Mapping, and Student Projects that display student generated data. There will be a separate submission page for students to input collected information into a database for the Community Mapping page.
